[Live Link] :https://github.com/TheRoyalTnetennba/cowboyBeatBox

CowboyBeatBox is a browser-based beatboxing app. It has a general layout and structure similar to others, with the added functionality of an avatar who dances to the user-specified beats.

This app will incorporate all of the basic beatboxing features with a few additions, outlined in the **Functionality & MVP** and **Bonus Features** sections.  

### Functionality & MVP  

Users will be able to:

- [ ] Mute all sound
- [ ] Select squares from a grid that represent different sounds and timings
- [ ] Watch Spike dance

In addition, this project will include:

- [ ] A production Readme

### Wireframes

This app will consist of a single screen with a grid of buttons, a tempo bar,  basic controls, and nav links to the Github, my LinkedIn. Game controls will include Start, Stop, and Reset buttons as well as a slider to control the tempo.

### Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6) for overall structure and game logic,
- `HTML5 Canvas` for DOM manipulation and rendering,
- Webpack to bundle and serve up the various scripts.
- Audacity for sound samples
- Piskel for sprite images0

In addition to the webpack entry file, there will be three scripts involved in this project:

`board.js`: this script will handle the logic for creating and updating the necessary `HTML5 Canvas` elements and rendering them to the DOM.

`cowboyBeatBox.js`: this script will handle the logic behind the scenes.

`spike.js`: this script will receive the data prepared by `board.js` and `cowboyBeatBox.js` to render spike's dancing.

### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**: Setup all necessary Node modules, including getting webpack up and running.  Create `webpack.config.js` as well as `package.json`.  Write a basic entry file and the bare bones of all 3 scripts outlined above.  Learn the basics of `Canvas HTML5`.

**Day 2**: Prepare basic UI and styling. Complete HTML skeleton with CSS stylings. Set appropriate onclick events for html elements.

**Day 3**: Build logic and visualizations for BeatBox portion. Build tempo functionality and select sound clips.

**Day 4**: Give Spike all the dance moves he needs to succeed. Draw sprites and correctly time their rendering with canvas.


### Bonus features

Some of the possible add-on features include:

- [ ] Using Web Speech API to sing/rap user input to a given beat.
- [ ] Adding the option to select from different Cowboy Bebop characters
